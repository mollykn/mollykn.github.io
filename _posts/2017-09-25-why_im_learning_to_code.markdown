<!-- **Update No 1.** // *Why I Decided to Learn How to Code *

Technology was never really my thing, I wish I could say that I was capitaved by computers or electronics and always tinkering with a chemistry set or homemade radio, I think the closest I got to electronics was making a potato clock in elementary school. For much of my life I studied life sciences, and am primarily interested in physiology and zoology, and how things worked at a microscopic level. College consisted of memorizing cellular pathways, elements and chemical reactions, growing bacteria in petri dishes, and testing lab samples for parasites. 

Growing up and navigating through post-grad life, my passions and tastes have changed, and I've discovered another world outside traditional life science study, one that requires learning how to code and learning software development. Software crosses many different disclipines and areas of interests, it's not just apps for getting ramen delivered late at night or catching rides somewhere when you don't want to give up your coveted parking spot 1/2 block from your apartment. I've learned that software is needed *everywhere*, not just techy things I've typically strayed from due to disinterest or the belief I'd never understand how they worked and why. But learning to code provides the framework for really working in any industry you enjoy. A few years ago I started a skincare company because I was interested in natural beauty and creating safe cosmetics. I had no idea how to do anything related to starting a business, but especially anything related to setting up a website and selling my products online. I never took the time to really learn how to build a website, and bought services that designed one for you, with minimal effort required on my part other than the layout of the pages and what goes on them. One thing I wish I did while starting a company was simultaneously learn how to build websites. A few years later, I've come full circle to wishing I knew how to understand software and web development. I saw Karlie Kloss start her Kode with Klossy program, and I stumbled upon the Flatiron School and started their free bootcamp course. I enjoyed seeing my efforts and works come to life right in front of me, on my computer. And the more I stuck with the bootcamp course, the more I enjoyed learning the different languages and their applications. -->
