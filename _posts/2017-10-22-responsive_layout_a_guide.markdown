<!--** Building Responsive Sites is practically a necessity now, given that people browse the internet on all sizes of devices: desktops, laptops, tablets, and smart phones. Websites need to be able to react to different screen sizes, and display a website format specially for that screen size, in order to present clear, un-jumbled, and easy-to-navigate sites. 

A **Responsive Site** is a single site that is viewable on different devices. 

**Device Detection** is done server side, and is done by checking to request the devices header info, in order to determine what size of a screen the device has. 

Some companies build seperate sites for mobile and desktop, i.e. Twitter has a desktop version https://twitter.com/ and a mobile version (https://mobile.twitter.com/session/new). This is ideal for repsonsive layouts, however develops have to fix & edit two seperate sites, which means a lot of maintance and work. 

Fortuntely, we can build repsonsive sites that work on a variety of screen sizes, and do not require the upkeep of two different sites. 

There are two methods for doing so: 
1. **Desktop Down**: In desktop down, the site is first designed to fit desktop devices, and in order to display on smaller devices, as the screen scales down, changes are made to the pages. 
*  i.e. holding or moving content to match screen area. We can change elements to a *fluid width* or switch from a multi column to a single column structure. 
*  Desktop Down is also know and **Graceful Degradation**

2. **Mobile Up** In mobile up, the site is first designed to fit mobile devices, and as the screen scales up, changes are made
* i.e. adding content, or moving it around to expand the display 
* Switching elements to a *fixed witdth*
* Mobile Up is also known as **Progressive Enhancements**

The deciding factor in whether or not to design a desktop down or mobile up site is based on the type of site or app, and where the majority of visitors will visit from, and what devices they will be using. 

For example, if you are a new and upcoming fashion company advertising on Instagram with sponsored ads or posts directing users to click on a link in your profil bio, you could use the *Mobile Up* design method, as the majority of visitors will come from those adds or social media links, and will most likely be on their smartphone or tablet. 

Howver if you are a large retail store, most of your site traffic will come from google shopping, google searches, or visitors going directly to your site. In this case, it would be better to build a *Desktop Down* site, since most visitors will be using their home computer or laptop. --!>
