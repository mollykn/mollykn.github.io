I was about 5 months in to my Flatiron School online coding school, and was beginning to feel unmotivated and really challeneged. I had still not yet finished the first section of the curriculum, and started to doubt myself if I could finish at the pace I wanted to finish at. 

Around the time I started the online program, I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 in hopes it would spark more interest in coding and give me a platform to do some side projects on. I decided to take a break from the coding school for a few days and work on some raspberry pi projects to re-spark my interest and curiosity in the world of coding. 

The first Raspberry Pi project I started with was an Instagram Bot. I had seen a lot of tutorials for Twitter Bots, and since I'm not too active with Twitter, I searched for an instagram version, and I found one! A youtube video and a blog post - perfect I thought!  

I began, and followed the instructions to a T. Most of it was gibberish to me since I haven't learned any python or more advaced languages yet, but I was able to follow along in the terminal and add the code. A couple hours later I had finished the tutorial, set up a fake account to act as my bot, and do my dismay - no working bot. I was bummed that I had nothing to show for my work, but once I read the youtube and blog comments, I noticed that many others' bots did not work. I shrugged it off and felt better that I knew how to set up my Pi and attempt a project. 

The next day, I strayed from googling specific Pi projects and found a website dedicated to Pi projects <A href='https://pimylifeup.com'>Pi My Life Up</a> and found a beginner project for my Pi that didn't require any specialized parts or equipment, called Setu your own Rasperry Pi Airplay Receiver. 

The tutorial basically involved connecting my Pi to a speaker, then installing software so that it becomes recognized as an AirPlay receiver over my Wifi, and to make it work, I used an open source software called Shairport Sync. 

I cloned in the shairpost-sync source into my Pi's terminal from Github, something I was familiar with through my Flatiroin education, and began running the commands in my Pi's terminal. The tutorial was straight forward and I was able to follow along, even if I didn't fully understand what the code was doing, I could see my terminal working and interpreting the code. I had some errors here and there, especially around the software not installing. I searched through the comments for answers. I made the corrections, but it still was not working. A little disheartened that my Pi project might not work, I decided to restart my Pi, and voila! the AirPlay receiver worked and I was able to play music from my laptop through the Pi speakers! 

I was so stoked and just so happy to finish this project and apply some of the knowledge I've learned from Flatiron in real life. It was very refreshing to step back from a student position of learning code, and always getting test errors and trying to debug, and seeing it in the real world. And at the end, I was no longer intimidated or put off by error messages - and I saw why error messages are great and actually trying to help you as a programmer. The experience taught me that figuring out how to fix error messages is actually pretty fun, and rewarding once you do and get the code working! I was able to return to the Flatiron curriculum a little more motivated and definitely less wary of error messages. 

I will continue doing Pi projects on the side, even if I'm not overwhelmed by the curriculum and learning. I think they are a great way to implement what I've learned at Flatiron, and just keep myself going through the program. It's a great mental break from reading and doing labs, and to just have some fun trying to figure out some code and work on a Pi. Doing little side projects here and there, and putting yourself in a "real life" programming situation really helps supplement the Flatiron material, and gives you the confidence to keep going, even if the curriculum gets hard or you're stuck on a lab for days.
